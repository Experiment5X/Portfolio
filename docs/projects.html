If the garbage stays full and is not emptied within 10 minutes then a text will be sent out to everyone in the house with a link to a GIF showing the person fill it up and not empty it. This was inspired by living with certain roommates.</p><p>I used a raspberry pi with a camera attached to it to capture the images of the garbage and perform all of the processing. I trained a machine learning model to classify pictures of my garbage can as either full or empty, to know when to trigger the notifications. To send out the texts to everyone I used the AWS service SNS which was really easy to set up. The device is configurable by visiting a website that runs on the pi.</p><div><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Python</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Keras</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Machine Learning</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Javascript</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Node</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Bootstrap</span></div></section><section id="seam-carving"><h4><a class="link-icon" href="https://github.com/Experiment5X/SeamCarving"></a> Seam Carving</h4><p>I came across the seam carving algorithm and thought it was really cool so I implemented it. The algorithm will resize images and preserve the content inside the image without stretching or scrunching parts of the image so it looks natural. I decided to code it up because I was curious to see how well it would work using a super simple implementation and it turned out to work quite well.</p><div><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Python</span></div></section><section id="deep-feature-visualization"><h4><a class="link-icon" href="https://github.com/Experiment5X/DeepFeatureVisualizationWebApp"></a> Deep Feature Visualization</h4><p>I was inspired by Chris Olah's work on visualizing convolutional neural networks so I built a tool of my own to visualize an image as it is passed through such a system. This web application allows you to visualize the representation of any image at any layer in the popular CNN VGG16. It works by passing the image through the network up to a certain layer to compute a feature map. To visualize this feature map gradient descent is performed to get another image with a feature map as close to the original image's feature map as possible. The loss for this optimization is simply the sum difference between the two feature maps.</p><p>This works quite well and some interesting images were produced using this technique. The web application I built makes it super simple to select a picture, and a layer in VGG16 that you want to visualize it at. The program also allows you edit some parameters that change the way the feature map visualization image is produced.</p><div><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Python</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Django</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Keras </span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Machine Learning </span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Javascript</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Bootstrap</span></div></section><section id="swisp"><h4><a class="link-icon" href="https://github.com/Experiment5X/Swisp"></a> Swisp</h4><p>This is a basic interpreter for a subset of lisp.

The file system used on the hard drives is a modified version of a FAT32, called FATX. There is a secure package format called STFS for storing player content that uses a merkle tree similar to ZFS to avoid corruption. These packages are also signed to prevent people from modifying them. However, all non-DLC is self-signed so Velocity has a feature to fix all of the hashes in the merkle tree and sign the file so that people can modify their profiles or savegames and their Xbox 360's will accept them.</p><p>I wrote this application alongside my friend, with both of us writing about 50% of the code. In order for us to understand how these file systems actually worked we reverse engineered the Xbox 360's kernel and system library code. There was some documentation online about STFS but it was incomplete. There were key details that were missing that we uncovered by understanding the PowerPC assembly. </p><p>On top of the library that we wrote implementing all of these file systems we built a GUI tool that allowed users to easily view the contents of their 360 hard drives and user content packages. We also created a profile editor tool providing features for users to modify locked aspects of your profile, unlock achievements and avatar awards at the click of a button. Users could create profiles, add games to their account, create picture packs, view Xbox executables, and games installed to their disk. When we released the application in 2013 we made a video showing it off on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-i8qUhX2jE">YouTube</a>. This was before we had support for hard drives, installed games, and executable files.</p><div><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">C++</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Qt </span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">PowerPC</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Reverse Engineering</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">File Systems</span></div></section><section id="xbdm"><h4><a class="link-icon" href="https://github.com/Experiment5X/XBDM"></a> XBDM</h4><p>XBDM is the protocol used to communicate with Xbox 360 development kits. You can do things like transfer files, set breakpoints, read memory, take screenshots, view processes, etc. The protocol is used my Microsoft's tools to help developers which will only run on windows. I wanted to be able to control mine from my mac so I reverse engineered Microsoft's library and used Wireshark to look at the network traffic. Once I understood the protocol I wrote this library in C++ so it would work cross platform. Then I wrote a cross-platform GUI manager using the Qt framework called <a href="https://github.com/Experiment5X/360DevManager">360DevManager</a>.</p><div><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">C++</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Qt </span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">x86</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Reverse Engineering</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary mx-1">Wireshark</span></div></section></div></div><div class="col-lg-2"></div></div></div></body></html>
